# Create block routines
An easy way of working with blocks in project base is to create the block through the package.json commands.

## Create a new block
To create a new block, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm run create-block
```

This will prompt you for the block name, and then create the block as a new plugin in the `plugins` directory.

## Create a innerblock block
To create a new innerblock block, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm run create-innerblock-block
```

This will prompt you for the block name, and then create the block as a new plugin in the `plugins` directory.
