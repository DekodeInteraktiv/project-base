## Cronjobs
List all non-standard cronjobs on the site and say a few words about the purpose of each of them.

## Anonymization
Project data is anonymized using a config file, `anonymize.config.json`, where the developer is expected to declare any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) for the project in a data structure relating to database tables and entries.

This anonymization is performed using the [anonymize-mysqldump project](https://github.com/DekodeInteraktiv/anonymize-mysqldump), where you can also see the [structure of the config file](https://github.com/DekodeInteraktiv/anonymize-mysqldump#config-file).

The default configuration file provides support for a vanilla WordPress installation, with just data relating to comments and usermeta accounted for.
